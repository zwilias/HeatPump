paragraph=Currently only support Mitsubishi Heat Pumps<br/>Library allows to pass a reference of the Serial you wish to use, such as Serial(esp8266) or Serial1(arduino micro pro).<br/>The library will "begin" the serial comms at 2400baud 8bits even parity.<br/>Make sure your board can handle 5V TTL, otherwise use a level shifter.<br/>Pull TX and RX to 5V with 10k resistors, otherwise the heat pump will not accept the connection.
